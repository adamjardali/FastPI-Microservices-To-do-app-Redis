# FastPI-Microservices-To-do-app-Redis
In this project I wanted to apply a project using the microservices approach. I created 2 entities and connected them to Redis. I used Redis stream to connect between them. A user can activate him self and add tasks then apply basic CRUD operations on the tasks.
